Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) regression analysis and user application blog:

# Week 1:

This first week was the initial planning stage outlining the subject matter of the project and what I want the end product to show in terms of skill and exploration.

# Week 2:

What did you do last week?

Last week I explored the direction I plan to go with my project, specifically creating a rough timeline and achievable goals. I'm still homing in on what is achievable with a wants v. needs type of approach. I plan to create a predictive model starting with one feature then expanding it. My priority is the backend workings of the model then linking it to a simple frontend design

What do you plan to do this week?

This week I plan to setup my website and do more research on applicable techniques as well as review my dataset and transforming it into usable information

Are there any impediments in your way?

Just myself, after a long break and this being my final semester it's been a slower ramp up than in the past but I'm simply focusing on doing one thing at a time. The short week and crazy snow storm had my week not really matching up with course schedules.

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

There wasn't much of a structured process last week, it was more so just doing some thinking and cursory google searches. I'm creating a little checklist of tasks this week to ramp back up into an efficient working setup.

# Week 3:

What did you do last week?

I completed the project proposal rough draft and decided on the specific frameworks I’ll be using for each person. I will be primarily using Flask, Python based modules, and SQLite. I did some preliminary data cleaning and identified the attributes with the best backing data.

 

What do you plan to do this week?

This week I plan to do some initial data transformation and exploration just to get in the flow of building this project. Additionally, I plan to set up my frontend Flask template to start a front-to-back approach to the application. I also plan to format my site.

Are there any impediments in your way?

Not particularly, time mostly. I think continuing to work on the steps I identified in the initial planning stage will help build momentum.

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

I spent a little too much time in the contemplation stage last week and this week I plan to take more action. Putting together the rough version of my frontend will motivate me to work on it once I see how ugly it is initially. Time is always a factor but I have put together a work/rest schedule for myself this weekend.

# Week 4:

What did you do last week?

Last week I finished the project proposals and reviewed the feedback I received to better home in on my project. Additionally, I began laying the foundation for the UI and some data preprocessing.

What do you plan to do this week?

This week I implemented a login page and database for users as well as laying the ground-work for my users attributes database. I used Flask for the front-end and SQLite for the database. I initially wrote the front-end in with simple logic and template rendering with placeholder names. Additionally, I got some free templates online and started to plug them in to my existing code.

Are there any impediments in your way?

This was a weird week and I was working without internet access for most of it which made some of the issues I ran into harder to solve. The upcoming week will be much more productive

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

My process last week was to simply do what I could given the circumstances. Next week should be much more normal and will allow me to utilize available resources much better. My small issues were solved by looking at previous code bases on my machine.

# Week 5:

What did you do last week?

I implemented a login page with a connected local database for simple login querying. As it is low on my priority list it's moreso the minimal needed to make the app work. I'm currently using a plan of creating a prototype app from front to back, then developing in a greater scope from back to front. 

What do you plan to do this week?

This week I need to focus on getting my website up and running, but this weekend I plan to do some heavy lifting on the dashboard and linking my analytical code to one or more features in the dashboard. Users entering values then getting a return value from my code for a single feature would be the benchmark by the end of the week.

Are there any impediments in your way?

No, considering last week wasn't as productive as I would have liked I have allocated more time to schoolwork this week. I have clear vision of what I want the application to look like by the end of the week and have drawn out a roadmap with bullet points of what I need for each benchmark.

Reflection on the process last week and how can I make it better?

Last week my process wasn't structured enough. This week I have a distinct plan both in my time and a roadmap for what I want accomplished and how I will do it.
