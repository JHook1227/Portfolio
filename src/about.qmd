My name is Joseph, a Senior Applied Computer Science student at CU Boulder with a focus in Data Science. Specifically I am drawn
to medical/health-related data projects and aspire to influence positive change for the community at large with my work.
I enjoy challenging problems that require creativity and technical skills to solve. My goal is to transition from a frontline health care worker to affecting change at a larger scale with analytical contributions
